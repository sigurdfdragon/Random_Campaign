    description= _ "Select an era, choose your faction, and lead it to victory against random factions over a series of random maps. For the standard experience, choose the Randon Campaign Default era.
(Intermediate level, 7 scenarios.)

The following unit advancement defines are enabled in this campaign: Armageddon Drake, Dwarvish Arcanister, Ancient Lich, & Orcish High Warlord.

Any Default or Age of Heroes style era can be selected. If an Age of Heroes style era is selected, the campaign will start at scenario 4. It's recommended to use normal eras (i.e. eras that are just collections of factions). If the era contains events or other game play mechanics, unexpected results or incompatabilities may occur.

The campaign is balanced for being played with 'use map settings', though any Generic setting under Configure Game can be changed, and will take effect throughout the campaign.
