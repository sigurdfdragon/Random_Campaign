0.8.3
	Works with 1.9.9 or greater

		a required depenency.

	Other minor tweaks and some code cleanup.

0.8.0
    Works with 1.9.5 & 1.9.6 Wesnoth
    Added a true multiplayer campaign for up to 3 players. Can be configured
        same way as the 1 player MP Campaign. If there are OOS errors or other bugs in
        the 3 player version, please post in the forums
    Added more random dialogue.
    Added some story.
    Removed 3 scenario campaign on the SP Campagin side as it's redundant.
    Removed 'Random' faction choice on SP Campaign, as there's no good reason to pick it,
        when you could get stuck with a leader that maxes out at level 2 for the whole campaign.
    Changed names of SP difficulty back to EASY, NORMAL, HARD; with appropriate gold values.
    Fog is present on all levels, shroud set to no,yes,yes for difficulty.

0.7.5
    Only for Wesnoth 1.9.5, as new terrain has been added to the maps (sand drifts & water lilies)
    Added new random map type, Island.
    Added a 1 player, 3 scenario campaign under multiplayer, allowing use of most Eras! & configuration of most settings.
    Various tweaks to most of the random maps.
    Changed name of time on Citadel from Indoors to Citadel.
    Added code to insure than no map is repeated during a campaign.
    
0.7.0
    Major map randomness added, 10 types of random maps. See /generators for a list
    Change of difficulty settings to Clear, Fog, Shroud.
    Only for Wesnoth 1.9.4 & up, as major use of new terrain & macros is made
    As there is a lot of variety amongst the maps, the turn limit has been removed
    Bonus gold (which wasn't being used) was removed
    Difficulty levels are now Clear, Fog, Shroud.
    Clear uses the previous Easy gold schedule, Fog & Shroud use the previous Normal gold schedule.
    Most of the code was cleaned up extensively.
    The map generators have just about everything in them macro'ed for easy readability
    Faction data is now read directly from the mainline multiplayer/factions/ files.
    This makes future updating easier & also makes it easier for knowledgeable users to edit Faction_Data.cfg file in the campagin to load their own factions/eras


0.6.0
    Menu improvements, 3 scenario AOH path added.
    Also released for the 1.8.5 version of Wesnoth (first & last one).

0.5.0
    First version, not very good compared to later versions.
